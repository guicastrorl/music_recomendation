## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a music recommendation system that provides personalized recommendations to users based on their music preferences. The system employs collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to generate recommendations.

## Features

- Collaborative filtering: Recommends music based on user behavior and preferences.
- Content-based filtering: Recommends music based on the attributes and features of the tracks.

## Dataset

We used a dataset containing information about artists, music tracks, and user interactions (listening history, likes, etc.). The dataset is crucial for training and evaluating our recommendation models.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involved cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a format suitable for modeling. We performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data's characteristics and distribution.

## Modeling

We employed collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to build our recommendation models. Collaborative filtering utilizes user behavior and preferences, while content-based filtering focuses on track attributes like genre, artist, and lyrics.

## Usage

To use the Music Recommendation System, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Preprocess your own dataset or use the provided sample dataset.
4. Train the recommendation models using the provided scripts.
5. Run the application to access personalized music recommendations.

## Future Improvements

Future improvements for the Music Recommendation System may include:
- Incorporating real-time user feedback to improve recommendations.
- Implementing deep learning models for better prediction accuracy.
- Enhancing the user interface for a seamless user experience.
